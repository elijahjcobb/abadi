							Rasoul joined Abadi lab as a MEEM Ph.D. student in 2017. He received his B.S. degree from Babol
							Noshirbani University of Technology in 2016. His top concerns are renewable energy, engineering
							for health, and desalinating water. In his undergrad, he worked on wave energy converters.
							Pursuing another of his top interests for his Ph.D. studies, his current focus is on the
							fabrication of conductive biomaterial microstructures with techniques like 3D bioprinting and
							their applications.
