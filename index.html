				<h2>About our Lab</h2>
				<p>Abadi Lab at Michigan Tech is an interdisciplinary lab focusing on solving problems at the interface
					of materials, mechanics, and nanoscience. Our lab employs advanced manufacturing techniques such as
					3D printing, bioprinting, and chemical vapor deposition to explore various engineering applications
					of advanced materials ranging from structural and electronic materials to tissue engineering and
					medical devices. A great focus of our lab is on conductive nanomaterials especially carbon
					nanotubes, carbon nanotube forests, graphene, and conductive nanomaterials incorporated in polymer
					composites. Visit other pages of this website to learn more about us and feel free to contact us if
					you have any questions or comments.</p>

						In <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.9b02927" target="_blank">our 2019
						paper</a> published in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces and highlighted on the cover, we
						report fabrication of biocompatible, electrically conductive and tough microfibers made of
						hyaluronic acid and single-walled carbon nanotubes by a wet spinning method. The microfibers
						presented excellent electrical conductivity, mechanical properties and stable actuation behavior
						in biological medium. In vitro cytocompatibility and in vivo biocompatibility experiments in
						mice were carried out, and showed that the fabricated microactuators are applicable in
						biomedical areas. Overall, the microfibers and bundles made with weaving the fibers exhibit
						excellent mechanical properties, stable electrical conductivity, good electrochemical and
						actuation behavior and, hence, prove to be promising materials for implantable microactuators
						and flexible electronic devices in biomedical applications.

						Immaturity of cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells is an important issue
						in the field of cell therapeutics. In
						<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.201707378/full" target="_blank">our
							2018 paper</a> published in Advanced Functional Materials and
						<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.201870128" target="_blank">
							highlighted on the cover</a>, we develop substrates with multi-scale topography resembling
						the three-dimensional features of the native heart environment to address the issue of
						immaturity of cardiomyocytes. The results show faster differentiation, enhanced maturity,
						and improved beating. Read the news about our article and group research in
